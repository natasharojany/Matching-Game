## 4/12/19
My group and I created our github repo and added our backlog that included the estimated difficulties of each implementation. We will start coding next class.

## 4/16/19
Today my group and I started the foundation of our program. 
  - We created a shared repl.it document where we could all work on our project at the same time
  - We put basic styling on the components of our game
  - Next time we will start getting into the actual coding of the game itself
  
## 4/22/19
- Today my group and I assigned values to the cards in our matching game and made the cards "flip" when we clicked them.
- We struggled working in repl.it and decided to switch over to sublime text which seems to be going better. We also struggled importing other languages/packages like lodash.
- Next class we will work on the shuffle/randomize function 

## 4/25/19
- Today Dani and I worked on the function that would flip the cards back if they did not match another
- We struggled with this a little but plan to work on it before next class
- Next class we will finish this function and then probably work on a counter that counts the amount of tiles that you click.

## 4/26/19
- Today I worked on a move counter that counts the number of clicks. I got it to work but then I changed some stuff around and experience a bug. 
- Over the weekend, I will work on fixing the bug and cleaning the code up
- We made good progress today as each member in our group worked on our own things. 
- We have yet been able to figure out how to add photos to the cards as well as make sure that the game knows when two cards that have been clicked are the same.

## 4/30/19
- Today I finished the move counter and started to code the reset button.
- For the reset button it was difficult to set the tiles back to their backs
- However, the group has been making steady progress.

## 4/12/19
My group and I created our github repo and added our backlog that included the estimated difficulties of each implementation. We will start coding next class.

## 4/16/19
Today my group and I started the foundation of our program. 
  - We created a shared repl.it document where we could all work on our project at the same time
  - We put basic styling on the components of our game
  - Next time we will start getting into the actual coding of the game itself
  
## 4/22/19
- Today my group and I assigned values to the cards in our matching game and made the cards "flip" when we clicked them.
- We struggled working in repl.it and decided to switch over to sublime text which seems to be going better. We also struggled importing other languages/packages like lodash.
- Next class we will work on the shuffle/randomize function 

## 4/25/19
- Today Dani and I worked on the function that would flip the cards back if they did not match another
- We struggled with this a little but plan to work on it before next class
- Next class we will finish this function and then probably work on a counter that counts the amount of tiles that you click.

## 4/26/19
- Today I worked on a move counter that counts the number of clicks. I got it to work but then I changed some stuff around and experience a bug. 
- Over the weekend, I will work on fixing the bug and cleaning the code up
- We made good progress today as each member in our group worked on our own things. 
- We have yet been able to figure out how to add photos to the cards as well as make sure that the game knows when two cards that have been clicked are the same.

## 4/30/19
- Today I finished the move counter and started to code the reset button.
- For the reset button it was difficult to set the tiles back to their backs
- However, the group has been making steady progress.

## 5/1/19
- I got the reset button to set the moves back to zero and the tiles back to their original positions
- I am struggling with having the reset button set the timer back to zero
- We have been making a lot of progress as a group, though.


## 5/3/19
- Unfortunately, my computer broke today so I worked with Dani on fixing the cards in order to only allow 2 cards to flip.
- We were also still struggling with the reset button as we could not get it to reset the timer back to 0.
- Next class we will try to add images to the cards or just colors on the backs of them.

## 5/8/19
- Today Lance and I worked out the final bugs with the reset button and got it to reset the board as well as the moves and the time.
- The challenge that we faced was a type error where we had the wrong type of quotation marks.
- Our game is pretty much finished, however we are going to try to implement a win/game over message.

## 5/14/19
- Today I continued working on a win message that prints how many clicks it took for you to complete the game as well as the amount of time it took
- I did some research but wasn't able to find anything suitable for our game's case.
- I will continue to work on this next class

## 5/16/19
- Today I got the win message to work but only for the number of moves, not the amount of time it took. 
- However, I noticed that after the message pops up and once you close it, the timer keeps going and the board doesn't reset. 
- Next class, I will try to perfect this.

## 5/17/19
- I made a lot more progress on the win message. I got it to print the number of seconds that it takes however I haven't been able to make it show minutes if you go over a minute.
- I also noticed another bug where once you have completed the game and the win message shows up and once you click "OK" the time gets set back to 0 but if you press start game right away it continues from the number of seconds it took you for the last game.
- Next time I work on this I will attempt to fix it.

## 5/22/19
- Today I completed the win message so that there are no bugs anymore.
- As a group, we played around with styling a little bit but made no major changes.

## 4/12/19
My group and I created our github repo and added our backlog that included the estimated difficulties of each implementation. We will start coding next class.

## 4/16/19
Today my group and I started the foundation of our program. 
  - We created a shared repl.it document where we could all work on our project at the same time
  - We put basic styling on the components of our game
  - Next time we will start getting into the actual coding of the game itself
  
## 4/22/19
- Today my group and I assigned values to the cards in our matching game and made the cards "flip" when we clicked them.
- We struggled working in repl.it and decided to switch over to sublime text which seems to be going better. We also struggled importing other languages/packages like lodash.
- Next class we will work on the shuffle/randomize function 

## 4/25/19
- Today Dani and I worked on the function that would flip the cards back if they did not match another
- We struggled with this a little but plan to work on it before next class
- Next class we will finish this function and then probably work on a counter that counts the amount of tiles that you click.

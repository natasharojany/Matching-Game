My group and I created our github repo and added our backlog that included the estimated difficulties of each implementation. We will start coding next class.

## 4/16/19
Today my group and I started the foundation of our program. 
  - We created a shared repl.it document where we could all work on our project at the same time
  - We put basic styling on the components of our game
  - Next time we will start getting into the actual coding of the game itself
